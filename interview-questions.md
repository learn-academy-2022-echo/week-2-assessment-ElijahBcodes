# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: Parameters help us to define what type of data can be passed and acted upon based on out argument. Parameters can only accept one value where as arguments are dynamic and can pass multiple arguments and parameters.

Researched answer: Functions need something to run and it takes in parameters like type, index, or array. The argument is what takes those parameters and performs some kind of logic.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: The .map() and .filter() built in methods require a value
 but the index and array are optional. ie .map(value,index, array). The map method iterates through an array and returns the array with whatever function or instructions you gave it. The filter instead just returns the values selected by the criteria set. l
Researched answer:The .map() function iterates through an array and returns a new array of the same length. 

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: The .map method will return a new array with the values from the original array. The .filter() method will return the same array but with only the values selected.

Researched answer: The filter() method does not mutate on the array it is called upon. The filter method instead makes a copy of the data filtered. The .map() function creates a new array from the result of a function being called on all the elements in a the called upon array. 

4. What is the DOM? 

Your answer:The DOM is the display object model. Everything that is basically displayed and rendered onto a screen using code. 

Researched answer: The DOM is the Document Object Model. The visuals being displayed on a screen. Represent the entire HTML doc as an object.

5. What is React? Why would you use it?

Your answer: React is a JavaScript library made by developers at Facebook. They needed a faster way to render data in real time without having to refresh a page. So that when you are looking at a website and you do something it can happen without refresh. This made web pages faster and more responsive. Common use would be something like a like button, a counter, something to tell the user they clicked on something. Definitely useful for rendering web pages in mobile applications and online gaming. 

Researched answer: JS library that can be used to make Webpages , mobile native mobile apps. It is component based, meaning that we build out many interchangeable parts that we then use to build the project. It is like working with Legos of code basically. This was very scalable and is very useful when handling user interactions. This meant that even if they received a large influx of users all the webpages would still be fast and responsive. 

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: I have heard of that mentioned in React and Javascript libraries. I would have to research that and I am sure I could find that right away. I was actually planning on researching that and implementing that into a react project. 

Researched answer: It allows to call functions before they appear in code. JS only hoist declarations, not initializations. As developers in JS we always want to declare the variables before any code is executed. If it is declared after the call of the function it will not be included. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories:How we would describe the features of a software system. Written using the end users point of view. So what as a user can I expect to be able to do with this program of software.

2. Spread operator: Allows an iterable like an array or string to be enlarged in places where zero or no arguments or data.

3. React props: Any data passed into a React component. Similar to html attributes. Written inside component calls.

4. Conditional rendering:In React conditional rendering works the same way conditionals work in Javascript. Uses operators like if , && 

5. DOM events: These events are basically any changes that occur in the document based on user inputs. We can use event listeners to trigger Javascript functions.
